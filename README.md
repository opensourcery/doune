**Note**

Development has moved back to [Drupal.org](http://drupal.org/project/doune).

Responsive HTML5 base theme using the [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com) CSS grid system.

## Features
* Added "push-by-" and "pull-by-" responsive grid classes to Skeleton
* Includes [Formalize CSS](http://formalize.me) for form styling
* Integrates with [Context Layouts](http://drupal.org/project/context) to allow setting region classes differently for each layout, via <code>hook_doune_layouts_alter()</code>.
* Responsive styling is all in responsive.css (so you can remove it from certain pages using [hook\_css\_alter()](http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/modules--system--system.api.php/function/hook_css_alter/7).)

## Credit
Doune draws inspiration and adapts code from the following projects:

* [AdaptiveTheme](http://drupal.org/project/adaptivetheme): HTML5+RDF DOCTYPE
* [Boron](http://drupal.org/project/boron): Override of meta content-type tag
* [HTML5 Base](http://drupal.org/project/html5_base): HTML5 templates
* [Tao](http://drupal.org/project/tao): Pager theming, core CSS exclusion

## What is a responsive layout?
CSS @media queries allow declaring styles conditionally, based on properties of the device viewing the document. In the case of responsive layout, this conditional CSS is used to make a site modify its layout to fit mobile devices' (e.g. smartphones, tablets) screens without requiring any horizontal scrolling. See [this *A List Apart* article](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/).

## Doune 7.x-2.x subthemes
* The [Railroaded Footnotes](http://railroaded.stanford.edu) site implements responsive layout within the Footnotes, Gallery, and Search sections.

## Other responsive layout examples
* [Gallery of responsive layout sites](http://mediaqueri.es/).
